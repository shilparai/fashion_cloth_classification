# fashion_cloth_classification

MNIST fashion dataset to build a CNN model using Keras. This is a tutorial to learn basics of CNN. I will be starting with baseline model and then improving the performance by redesigning the cnn architecture.


**Steps for building CNN using TensorFlow**

1. Import required libraries  
2. Load training and testing dataset  
3. Analyze the dataset  
4. Normalize the dataset for inputting into CNN  
5. Build the CNN model (baseline)  
6. Evaluate the model  
7. Improve the accuracy of the model
